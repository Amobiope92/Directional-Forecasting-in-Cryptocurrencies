# Directional-Forecasting-in-Cryptocurrencies
Predicting whether crypto prices will surge or decline

# Description
We live in a renaissance era for quantitative finance and decentralized systems. We attempt to combine the two, by building predictors of crypto assets. Cryptocurrency markets operate 24/7, with prices that can change rapidly. For traders and investors, predicting the direction of a crypto asset's price in the short term can be the difference between profit and loss. In this competition, your challenge is to predict the direction of a crypto asset's price movement for the next minute based on historical data.

Given a dataset containing minute-by-minute price information of one crypto asset, you are tasked with building a model that can accurately predict whether the price of a cryptocurrency will move up (1) or stay the same/move down (0) in the next minute.
